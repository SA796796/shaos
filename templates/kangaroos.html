<p>Kangaroos belong to the <strong>Macropodidae</strong> family, meaning <strong>‘big foot’</strong> in Latin, in
    reference to the species’ unusually large hind feet.</p>

<p>The word kangaroo derives from <em>'Gangurru'</em>, the name given to Eastern Grey Kangaroos by the Guuga Yimithirr
    people of
    Far North Queensland. Kangaroos are of cultural and spiritual significance to Aboriginal people across Australia.
    Plus, their meat was, and continues to be, a staple protein source; pelts were used for clothing and rugs; and their
    skin crafted into water bags.</p>
