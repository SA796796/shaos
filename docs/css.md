# CSS

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a [stylesheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheet) language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

[CSS first steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps). CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

[CSS building blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks). This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.

[Styling text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text). With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.

[CSS layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout). At this point, we've looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to correctly arrange your boxes in relation to the viewport as well as to one another. We've covered the necessary prerequisites, so let's dive deep into CSS layout, looking at such various features as: different display settings, positioning, modern layout tools like flexbox and CSS grid, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
